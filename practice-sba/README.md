# ID512 Fundamentals of Web Development 

15 credits at level 5

## Skills Based Assessment practice exam

All the tasks in this assessment will be assessing all of the learning outcomes for this course:

1. Use fundamental components of web pages and basic client/server communication. 

2. Develop simple web-based applications using industry relevant client/server-side programming languages. 

3. Use industry relevant tools and workflows in the development of web-based applications. 

## Instructions

Clone this repo on to your computer to start the assessment. Please read these instructions thoroughly before you begin.

### Conditions

You have until 4.45pm to complete this assessment - any commits made after that time will be rolled back before marking.

This is an open book test: you are allowed to Google as much as you like or read through your own notes but you are not to communicate with any other person face to face or remotely -- your work must be your own. 

**Do not submit any code that you wouldn't be able to explain in detail. We reserve the right to require a code defence.**

### Tasks

The assessment consists of three tasks with multiple steps each. The instructions are given in a comment at the top of each task. Later tasks rely on code written for earlier tasks. Please only write code in the areas specified by comments.

You must commit and push your changes at the end of each task at minimum. You may make more frequent commits than this if you wish to. Please ensure your commit messages are concise desciptions of your changes.

Each task is worth a certain number of points as specified. You will get more marks for writing cleaner, more maintaibale code. Messy or redundant code will earn fewer marks, even if it works. Partial marks can be given for code that won't run if you were very close to the right solution, though keep in mind that broken code can cause issues in other parts of the assessment so it might be a good idea to comment it out with an explantion of why.

### Submission

When you are finished all three tasks, please make sure you have submitted all your code by pushing it to GitHub.
